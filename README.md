## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) – JavaScript runtime
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) – Version control system
* [Docker (optional)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) – For running in isolated environments and streamlined deployments

### Minimum Version Support

```bash
node >= v10.16.0
npm >= 6.9.0
git >= 2.17.1
```

These versions are recommended to ensure compatibility with the React scripts and dependencies used throughout the template.

### 🐳 Using Docker

You can run the project inside a Docker container:

```bash
# Build Docker image
docker build -t mua-tech-developer-portfolio:latest .

# Run the container on port 3000
docker run -t -p 3000:3000 mua-tech-developer-portfolio:latest
```

This makes it easy to develop in a clean, reproducible environment without manually setting up Node.js or other dependencies.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

Follow these steps to get started locally and start customizing your portfolio:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/musamaakhtar-tech/mua-tech-developer-portfolio.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd mua-tech-developer-portfolio

# Create a .env file
cp env.example .env

# Install dependencies

## 🔗 Linking Portfolio to GitHub

Automatically display your GitHub repositories and contributions by integrating the GitHub API directly into your portfolio.

1. Generate a GitHub personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add the following lines to your `.env` file:

```env
REACT_APP_GITHUB_TOKEN="YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN"
GITHUB_USERNAME="musamaakhtar-tech"
USE_GITHUB_DATA="true"
```

This enables dynamic loading of your repositories, stats, activity graph, and contribution streaks, giving visitors a live snapshot of your coding life.

---

## ✍️ Linking Blogs Section to Medium

Integrate your latest Medium posts into the portfolio and keep your audience updated with your thoughts, insights, and tutorials.

### Setup:

```env
MEDIUM_USERNAME="your_medium_username"
```

In `portfolio.js`, enable the blog section:

```js
const blogSection = {
  displayMediumBlogs: true,
};
```

The blog section fetches your latest Medium articles and renders them with clean, minimal styling that matches the overall aesthetic.

---

## 🎨 Customization

Easily customize every section by editing `/src/portfolio.js`. Configure:

* Greeting & introduction
* Social links
* Skills & technologies
* Experience & projects
* Achievements & certifications
* Blog, podcasts, talks
* Twitter feed

This single configuration file controls most of the displayed content, enabling fast iteration and editing.

### SEO & Metadata

Update `public/index.html` to include custom page titles, Open Graph tags, and meta descriptions to boost SEO and improve discoverability.

### Resume Upload

Place your resume in the designated directory:

```
src/containers/greeting/resume/resume.pdf
```

You can link this file through your profile's greeting section so recruiters and clients can easily download it.

### Animation Control

Customize or replace Lottie animations via the JSON files in `src/assets/lottie` or modify component logic in `DisplayLottie.js` to reflect a different visual style.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### 📘 GitHub Pages

1. Edit `package.json`:

```json
"homepage": "https://<your-username>.github.io/mua-tech-developer-portfolio"
```

2. Deploy using:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will push your site to the `gh-pages` branch and make it available at the specified GitHub Pages URL.
